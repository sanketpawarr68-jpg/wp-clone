# How to Run the WhatsApp Clone Project

This project consists of a frontend (Vite + React) and a backend (Node.js + Socket.io).

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed

## Step 1: Run the Backend Server

1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the `server` directory:
   cd server
3. Install dependencies (first time only):
   npm install
4. Start the server:
   npm start
   # or for development with auto-restart:
   npm run dev

The backend server will run on `http://localhost:3000` (or the port defined in `server/index.js`).

## Step 2: Run the Frontend Application

1. Open a new terminal.
2. Navigate to the project root directory:
   cd .. # if you are in the server folder
   # otherwise, cd to the project root
3. Install dependencies (first time only):
   npm install
4. Start the frontend development server:
   npm run dev

The frontend application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Step 3: Start the Tunnel (for remote access/testing)

This step is optional but useful for testing on mobile or other devices.

1. Open a new terminal.
2. Navigate to the project root directory.
3. Run the tunnel script:
   node start-tunnel.cjs

This will generate a public URL that tunnels to your local frontend.
